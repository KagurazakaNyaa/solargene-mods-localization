phobos_description,"<b>Phobos</>\n Phobos is the largest moon of Mars and is characterized by its irregular shape with a diameter of about 22.4 kilometers. It has no atmosphere to speak of, making it a perfect destination for exploration.  In approximately 50 mio. years it will collide with mars and form a ring like structure just like Saturn but smaller. Small amouts of minerals can be found here.",
deimos_description,"<b>Daimos</>\n Deimos, the smaller and outermost moon of Mars, has a smoother and less cratered surface compared to Phobos due to a thicker layer of regolith. It is one of the smallest known moons in the solar system and orbits Mars at a much greater distance than Phobos.",
ceres_description,"<b>Ceres</>\n Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt and the only dwarf planet within it. It has a differentiated structure with a rocky core and icy mantle and is thought to contain significant amounts of water. The bright spots in the Occator Crater, believed to be deposits of salts, are among its most intriguing features.",
pallas_description,"<b>Pallas</>\n Pallas is the second-largest asteroid in the asteroid belt and has an irregular, heavily cratered shape. It is rich in silicates and shows evidence of partial differentiation. Pallas has an unusually inclined orbit compared to most asteroids.",
vesta_description,"<b>Vesta</>\n Vesta is the brightest asteroid visible from Earth and has a differentiated interior with a metallic core, silicate mantle, and crust. Its surface features include large impact basins like Rheasilvia, with a central peak that is one of the tallest in the solar system. Vesta is considered a protoplanet due to its complex geological history.",
juno_description,"<b>Juno</>\n Juno is a relatively small asteroid in the asteroid belt, notable for its high reflectivity and silicate-rich composition. It has an irregular shape and lacks the geological complexity seen in larger asteroids like Vesta and Ceres.",
iapetus_description,"<b>Iapetus</>\n Iapetus, a moon of Saturn, is famous for its two-tone appearance, with one hemisphere being dark and the other bright. Its equatorial ridge gives it a unique walnut-like shape, and its low density suggests it is composed primarily of water ice with a small rocky core.",
hyperion_description,"<b>Hyperion</>\n Hyperion is an irregularly shaped and sponge-like moon of Saturn, known for its highly porous structure. Its chaotic rotation and heavily cratered surface make it one of the most peculiar moons in the solar system.",
rhea_description,"<b>Rhea</>\n Rhea is Saturn's second-largest moon, made mostly of water ice with a small rocky core. Its surface is heavily cratered and features bright streaks believed to be ice deposits. It may have a thin atmosphere composed of oxygen and carbon dioxide.",
dione_description,"<b>Dione</>\n Dione, a moon of Saturn, has a heavily cratered surface with bright, wispy streaks of ice cliffs on its trailing hemisphere. These features suggest tectonic activity in its past. Like Rhea, it is composed mainly of water ice with some rocky material.",
tethys_description,"<b>Tethys</>\n Tethys is a bright, icy moon of Saturn with two prominent features: the massive Ithaca Chasma, a canyon system, and the large Odysseus Crater. Its low density indicates it is almost entirely made of water ice.",
mimas_description,"<b>Mimas</>\n Mimas, another of Saturn's moons, is famous for the enormous Herschel Crater, which gives it a resemblance to the Death Star from ""Star Wars."" It is composed primarily of water ice and has a heavily cratered surface.",
oberon_description,"<b>Oberon</>\n Oberon is the second-largest moon of Uranus, with a dark, heavily cratered surface marked by large impact basins. It may have a subsurface ocean and is composed of a mix of ice and rock.",
titania_description,"<b>Titania</>\n Titania is Uranus's largest moon and shows evidence of past geological activity, including canyons and fault systems. Its surface is a mix of ice and rock, and it may harbor a subsurface ocean.",
umbriel_description,"<b>Umbriel</>\n Umbriel, a moon of Uranus, is the darkest of its major moons due to its heavily cratered and old surface. It is composed mainly of water ice with some rocky material and possibly methane ice.",
ariel_description,"<b>Ariel</>\n Ariel is one of Uranus's brightest and most geologically active moons, with a surface marked by valleys, fault scarps, and flows. Its relatively young surface indicates ongoing tectonic activity.",
miranda_description,"<b>Miranda</>\n Miranda, a small moon of Uranus, is known for its dramatic and varied terrain, including canyons, ridges, and large fault scarp features called coronae. Its surface is a mix of heavily cratered and geologically younger regions.",
eris_description,"<b>Eris</>\n Eris is the second-largest known dwarf planet in the solar system and is located in the scattered disk region beyond Neptune. It is slightly smaller than Pluto and has a highly reflective surface, likely covered in frozen methane",
makemake_description,"<b>Makemake</>\n Makemake is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt with a bright, icy surface composed of methane, ethane, and nitrogen. It lacks a significant atmosphere but has at least one known moon.",
pluto_description,"<b>Pluto</>\n Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt with a diverse and active surface, featuring nitrogen ice plains, mountain ranges, and possible cryovolcanoes. Its thin atmosphere primarily consists of nitrogen, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide.",
charon_description,"<b>Charon</>\n Charon is Pluto's largest moon, roughly half its size, and is gravitationally locked with it in a mutual orbit. It has a rugged surface with deep chasms, a reddish polar region, and signs of past geological activity.",
haumea_description,"<b>Haumea</>\n Haumea is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt known for its elongated, football-like shape caused by its rapid rotation. It has a surface of crystalline water ice and two small moons, Hiʻiaka and Namaka.",
proteus_description,"<b>Proteus</>\n Proteus is one of Neptune’s largest moons, with an irregular shape and a dark, heavily cratered surface. Its largest crater, Pharos, is a prominent feature, and it is likely composed of water ice and rock.",
