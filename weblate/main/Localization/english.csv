Human insulin (humulin) obtained through recombinant DNA has been actively used for quite a long time. Cloned human insulin genes were inserted into a bacterial cell, where it began synthesizing a hormone that natural microbial strains never synthesized.

Today we were able to solve a lot of problems: self-organization of particles, formation of agglomerates, data transfer from nano to micro level and back.

In addition, many other problems were solved, such as the emergence of tritium, the need for improved superconducting magnets, and refractory materials. Before getting the energy output, a large amount of energy is needed to start the reactor for the sake of raising the temperature and pressure enough to start fusion.
We use the fusion reaction of deuterium and helium-3, producing a proton and a helium-4 atom and 18.3 MeV from each fusion.",""

In addition, cosmic radiation is not really beneficial to the growth of a living thing.
Now we have developed leveflores plants, they are able to grow and reproduce with low gravitational force. Externally they look the same as before, but at the microscopic level there are still differences: new fractal structures with an almost infinite area of rhizome cover and improved ""internal organs"" of cells allow the new plants to please us with their unfading appearance.

The chances of a new organ taking root are about one. The body's own extracellular matrix accelerates healing and allows the organ to take root faster.
It's unfortunate to see a lot of outdated technology fade into oblivion. But that's progress. Imagine Stephen Hawking on his feet expounding in his own voice about his M-theory and rejoice that many more creators will be able to give this world a little more.",""

That project started back in 1990, and by 2003 only 85% of the human genome, three billion nucleotide pairs, had been sequenced. The project was completed in 2022.
The experience gained and modern technology make it possible to decipher the genome of any creature much faster than before. Storing data on the genetic code of a huge number of creatures is nothing short of a modern Noah's Ark. In the future, this may allow the creation of entire ecosystems from a test tube, and advances in genetic engineering will solve the problem of their reproduction on non-native planets. The findings open up access to new research. We have created the Big Data of all life on Earth, an event that is hard to overestimate.",""
"research_done_description_nanosensors","The ability to install sensors of negligible size, capable of detecting almost anything and analyzing the data obtained, facilitates the production and operation of the equipment.
Miniaturization itself reduces material consumption, although production remains quite complicated at first. These sensors are not capable of self-replication, their task is to record the state of the environment.
This means that now we will be able to observe the presence of toxins directly in cells, have antennas 1 µm long, surfaces one atom thick to detect different radiations or pressure, robots able to sense flavor and taste in all their glory, sensors with incredible sensitivity, and much more.",""
"research_done_description_compositeNanomaterials","Composite nanomaterials are the result of the fusion of nanotechnology and the creation of composite materials. Nanocomposites are materials formed by introducing nanoscale particles (fillers) into a structured solid phase (matrix).
People as far back as Ancient Rome obtained nanocomposites by adding lime, volcanic sand and sea water to make cement mortar. Today, these materials, both isotropic and oriented, push back the limits of strength, lower the coefficients of thermal expansion, and in some cases increase the flexibility of things we are used to. In most cases, at the molecular level, it looks like a molecular wood-laminated board impregnated with a binding fiber, and the layer is one atom thick.
In this way we can create thinner and stronger materials, from clothing to the skin of ships.",""
"research_done_description_safeNuclearEnergy","After a series of nuclear accidents, mankind seriously considered stop using energy from the atom. In space, nuclear power solves the problem of limited energy resources. Previously it was extremely difficult to create a safe enough reactor, that is also easy to maintain.
Modern technology makes nuclear fuel resources virtually unlimited, and the issue of disposal is solved by reprocessing with re-generation of energy. We can now use additional ""reactors"" for the next cycles of nuclear fuel with energy production. The polonium-210 isotope mixed with yttrium allows for nuclear self-contained units of compact size, and the emitted alpha radiation is fairly easy to protect against. Once spent in one reactor, the fuel undergoes a transfer cycle to another reactor, soon returning in its original state to the first vessel. This is not a perpetual motion machine, but the creation of nuclear fuel with multiple enrichment capabilities is an undeniable boon.",""
"research_done_description_rnaInterference","Drugs that activate the necessary cellular mechanisms based on RNA interference make it possible to get rid of most harmful viruses virtually harmlessly. Each drug is designed for similar groups of viruses and one cannot be used for another. The absence of habituation and the strong effect makes the remedies obtained indispensable in the treatment.
The mechanism is that the double-stranded viral RNA inside the cell is cut with amino acid-type molecular scissors and stops the synthesis of new viruses. Drugs specifically activate RNA interference mechanisms in cells. They can also be used to reduce the resistance of cancer cells, and in some cases it is possible to treat genetic diseases associated with synthesis disorders.",""
"research_done_description_syntheticMeat","Humanism is one of humanity's aspirations. Cultivating meat from a test tube not only brings us closer to the ideals, but also solves the problems of diet in space. Cultivation of animals for food purposes is quite resource- and energy-consuming even on Earth: it takes 15000 liters of water to produce 1 kg of beef, about 6000 liters for 1 kg of pork, and 4300 liters for 1 kg of chicken meat. In space, such wastefulness is unacceptable, but the ration must be observed.
Synthetic meat is not inferior to natural meat in its organoleptic properties and is healthier than soy. Thanks to tissue engineering now it is not just minced meat, but full-fledged muscle fibers. And no, it is not a vegetarian product. The problems of cell multiplication, bioculture, stem cell extraction, bioreactors have been solved: we have achieved tissue growth without antibiotics and hormones, synthetic meat is cleaner than farm-raised meat. All that remains is to figure out how to make barbecue in space.",""
"research_done_description_grownOrgans","Organ transplantation has long held the leading position in complexity among surgical procedures; not every specialist has sufficient skills to perform such a procedure. The main problem is that a donor organ remains rare to this day and cannot be stored for long. For these reasons, many patients simply do not wait for their surgery.
Today, however, we have access to a full range of organs, from the thymus to the heart, individually for each person from a sample of their DNA. Advances in tissue engineering are opening up the possibility of returning lost limbs, restoring vision, and replacing tissues and organs with their grown ""clones"". One of the important advantages is the absence of rejection by the recipient, since the transplanted organ is genetically his own.
This achievement does not negate the need for a transplant and a top-notch surgeon, but it allows one not to wait for donor organs, which are virtually non-existent in space conditions.",""
"research_done_description_individualGenomeSequencing","Once the sequencing of an individual's genome meant looking at a unique portion of the DNA strands, today we can quickly and accurately read an individual's complete genome. This would avoid many errors in medicine, qualitatively change new research into treatment, and improve rehabilitation options for the individual. The best part is that it is potentially possible to sequence the genome of cancer cells and pick up treatments almost without compromising health.
We can now track mutations from generation to generation, we can see how life in the cosmos affects homo as a whole, and anthropology now looks not only to the past, but also to the future.",""
"research_done_description_auxetics","Auxetic materials are called materials in which, when a tensile force is applied, the cross-section also increases. These materials are needed to create the moving part of nanobots made of cubic crystals and carbon lattices. Under the action of the external force, the materials will deform in the desired direction, advancing the nanoconstruction.
Such properties are due to the molecular structure in the form of honeycombs, squares or hourglasses. The materials themselves have sufficiently high strength and resistance to breakage.
Without auxetics, it is impossible to create nanobots. We have done a lot of work and designed many models for a variety of functions that use all sorts of ways to move, whether it is reactive motion, ""steps,"" helical motion, and so on.
Now we are ready to move directly to the creation of nanobots.",""
"research_done_description_nanotechnologyClothing","In space, rugged clothing capable of maintaining temperature, self-cleaning and literally being a second skin is essential. Such clothes can repel water from outside, kill bacteria, decompose dirt and sweat. In addition to the bacteria responsible for the bad smell suit of nanofabrics can destroy pathogens of dangerous diseases.
The developed fabrics have the ability to convert incoming visible light and ultraviolet light into electricity and store it. It is also possible to maintain a microclimate on the surface of the body without energy expenditure simply by controlling the pores of the surface. The cherry on the cake - the clothes can change color, texture and design.",""
"research_done_description_largesizeCarbonNanoconstructions","Many forms of carbon nanostructures have been discovered: dodecahedron-based fullerene, astralene, nanocone, and others. Their properties depend on the geometry - they can be ""sealed"" and store other substances in them, use the capillary effect, create antifriction additives or use as a part of composite materials, and if you reduce the diameter - there is a quantum effect.
Everything depended on learning how to create large area graphene and roll it up on an industrial scale. Electron microscopes helped to solve the problem, or rather the principle of their operation. We created apparatus capable of high-precision high-speed printing of the carbon lattice with the addition of magnetic elements, and the folding is done thanks to the magnetic field. After this process, the impurities are extracted and we have nanotubes of the required length on hand.",""
"research_done_description_metamaterials","These materials have properties that are beyond the capabilities of their constituent substances. ""Meta-"" translates from the Greek as ""outside"". All this is made possible because of the peculiar structure of the construction of the object at the molecular level: periodically reproduced atoms line up in the necessary size crystal lattices, in some cases the composition turns out to be amorphous. Developed methods of composite construction make negative dielectric and magnetic susceptibility, permeability, resonance amplification and redirection of electromagnetic waves available.
This will open the way to superconductivity, new optics, volume holograms, and the possibility of creating miniature, highly sensitive antennas will lead to accelerated data transmission over long distances with virtually no losses.",""
"research_done_description_superconductorsThatDoNotRequireCooling","Superconductivity is lossless energy transfer, and superconductors are materials that have zero resistance. Metals usually have a crystal lattice and free electrons that allow electricity to ""flow"" within it. Since metals are solids, depending on their temperature, the atoms will vibrate with a certain force and prevent electrons from passing through the conductor. Previously, to achieve the effect of superconductivity, one had to lower their temperature to almost absolute zero.
In addition to reducing energy loss, there is another curious property - this material is not penetrated by a magnetic field. Because of this, a magnet placed over the superconductor hangs in the air. In this way, it is possible to create a magnetic cushion transport that is faster than an airplane.
On the day the technology was discovered, we rejoiced - superconductors no longer require ultra-low temperatures and enormous pressure, and the materials obtained are superconductive under normal conditions.",""
"research_done_description_nuclearPowerPlant","It has finally happened: the size and capacity of the plants have been increased, and energy efficiency has made building a nuclear plant several times more cost-effective than using solar panels and other energy sources.
The problem of a sufficiently low melting point of polonium-210 was solved by using its oxide, which becomes unstable at temperatures above 36°C. In extraterrestrial conditions, a reactor temperature not exceeding 500°C is sufficient, in which case the fuel does not melt. Another advantage is safety: when the reaction slowly goes out of control, hydrogen is synthesized, which makes the oxide go to the state of metal, and the residue is water, the energy of which is always insufficient to explode.
The spent fuel is reprocessed with energy release in other compartments of the reactor, this allows it to be brought to its original state in the first position after a few cycles. Genius",""
"research_done_description_nuclearEngine","Nuclear rocket engines are similar in principle to nuclear reactors, using a mixture of plutonium carbides and uranium carbides as fuel, which is in a gaseous state when operating.
Reactive force is created by the flow of coolant around the heat-resistant vessels of the nuclear reactor, heated to 25,000°C. The liquid hydrogen comes out into the nozzle already with tremendous energy, expanding instantly. In this case jet velocity approaches 50 km/s, in chemical oxidation reaction it was 2-5 km/s.
Such an engine makes faster interplanetary flights available, but while man is not able to withstand large overloads for a long time, it is important to perform a smooth launch and braking. Another feature is the reduction of fuel consumption at the start, which means that without a change in fuel mass the distance of flights can be increased.",""
"research_done_description_unrelentingAntibiotics","For many years mankind has been fighting the bacterial threat with antibiotics of various types. Most of them work by destroying the bacterial envelope, but, as always, a bacterium capable of resistance emerges and creates a colony of its own kind. Following this, the effectiveness of antibiotics decreases as resistant microorganisms replace all others due to the mass use of antibiotics. They often lose their rate of spread, but still survive, continuing their pathogenic effects.
We have been able to go through many variants of substances and find those to which the microorganisms have no defense, and the spread of mutant resistant colonies is in practice impossible. Bacteria have a danger warning mechanism, a sense of quorum that is blocked by the compound, so they remain defenseless even after 50 generations. This is truly the greatest day in medicine.",""
"research_done_description_carbohydrateProteinPlants","Svea fineleaf, climacoptera, oilseeds, legumes, and cereals gave the necessary genome combinations to create plants capable of assimilating both carbohydrates and proteins. Unification was only possible on harvests, which have traits of ancient algae and modern plants. The ""rolling back"" and modification of modern cultivated plants did not produce an impressive result, but we found indirect signs of genetic modification in some, despite the fact that these species have existed intact for several thousand years. This is quite curious.
From the resulting samples, it is possible to obtain fruits that are high in both carbohydrates and proteins at the same time. They are not rich in micronutrients, but they have enough essential fats for a complete diet. A 100 g of fruit contains 25 g of protein, 22 g of fat, 33 g of carbohydrates, 9 g of fiber and 11 g of water. This ratio is an almost perfect balance of the daily diet for maintaining body weight. It has an incomparable taste",""
"research_done_description_luminescentPlants","Bioluminescence is characteristic of fungi and bacterial colonies; plants are incapable of it in nature. Fluorescence works like this: when exposed to ultraviolet light, there is an energy transition in the electron layers, part of the energy is absorbed and part is sent back in the visible light range. Bioluminescence, on the other hand, is the result of luminescence due to chemical reactions.
We have combined both effects. Luminescence makes it possible to observe the processes inside the plant, to stop mass diseases of the crops at an early stage. Such glow attracts more insects. All this makes it possible to increase yields.
In addition to being aesthetically pleasing, we get a kind of indicator of the sufficiency of light consumed by the plant. If the fluorescence is not bright enough - then we need to add UV light or properly feed the plant for effective growth, otherwise save energy.
The brightness of some specimens is enough to use them as nightlights.",""

Thanks to increased life expectancy and the three demographic transitions we have already undergone, we will have a society with the healthiest, most efficient, educated and able-bodied people possible. This solves many social problems that are relevant even outside the home planet. The process of demographic stabilization can be considered complete.

In order to protect this copy during transfer from destruction in the body, a ""transport"" in the form of, for example, neutralized human adenovirus, the shell becomes the vehicle and replicator.
We get a kind of vaccine, with a working copy of the necessary gene, we call it a vector. A large number of vectors are then injected into the body.

Thus, the basis for stable molecular structures in the universe became much more than the lighter lithium, beryllium and boron.
Graphene has unique properties, among them: high strength, conductivity and the ability to accumulate charge. It is the latter that interests us to create a product that can be quickly charged and hold a charge for a long time, while being safe to use.

These materials are undesirable in integrated optics because of the disproportionate distortion in the modulated signal. Their use in optics is most appropriate.
The refractive capabilities of optical deflectors and modulators allow us to adjust the strength of the beam and correct its focus.

That's when pseudo-alloys were developed: tungsten powder was pressed into the shape of the nozzle, and the resulting porous structure was filled with copper, diffusion did its job - this material could work at very high temperatures for a short time.
We created materials with extremely low thermal conductivity and incredible heat capacity, which look solid but are actually dense, amorphous.

When the combustion products flow through the nozzle, the temperature of the gases drops, reaching a minimum value at the outlet.

Speeding up the rhythms is not difficult, and slowing down is an art. We now know how to slow the body down two or three times for certain intervals at times when we need it. We lower the temperature to 28°C and make the heart beat no more than 20 times a minute, under these conditions the body needs less than 800 kcal per day.

For example, it is possible to use white blood cells ""super-trained"" specifically on tumor RNA. A fat cell is endowed with the genome of cancer cells and then injected into the body to train the immune system, which is incapable of spotting the disease.

The process involves a purified egg cell as well as a skin cell nucleus with restored chromosome telomeres, which is injected inside. The resulting zygote is placed in an incubator with a low electric field, and the embryo begins to develop. After 2 years, an adult emerges from the incubator, which must be controlled, accelerated and educated in its moral qualities, giving life meaning and purpose. They are as intelligent as we are.
To overcome some ethical barriers, clones are created sterile, for they cannot be called natural humans in any way, and it is rather difficult to predict changes in the genotype of a colony. Each station can choose its own representative for cloning or use ready-made material.",""
"research_done_description_androids","Making a robot walk like a human was once a huge problem, because walking upright is the most complex locomotion, a series of controlled falls, a synergy of the entire body and many sensors. But giving it the ability to think like a living being is even more difficult.
The first samples were poorly trained, did not have the intuition for action that humans have, were heavy and slightly clumsy, fragile, despite the fact that they moved perfectly. Their motor parts left much to be desired and broke down very quickly. We made them better, faster, the moving parts became more durable, but they still needed periodic maintenance, and a little later the problem was solved with nanobots.
All that was left was to endow this entity with artificial intelligence, and finally we got a completely synthetic creature that passes the Turing test and is able to do almost any work for a person.
The robot is capable of memorization, improvisation and reflection. And until they ask themselves existential questions.",""
"research_done_description_antigravity","In a state of weightlessness, the human body loses in several parameters: in weight, bone density, muscle tone, and immunity level. In order to avoid this and to be able to quickly get to work on a colonized planet, we used ships with simulated gravity by applying centrifugal force.
Back on Earth, experiments were conducted to create artificial gravity. Rotating and accelerating rings of superconductors generate a gravitational field. This effect is called the London Gravitational Momentum. Advances in energy generation, superconductors, as well as experiments with femtotechnology have made it possible to multiply the gravitational effect obtained once on Earth, so much so that it was enough to achieve the usual gravitational force.
Since it is the accelerating superconductors that are needed, we use cascades that gain momentum one at a time. In practice, the pulsational attenuations of gravity are almost imperceptible.",""
"research_done_description_industrialTelekinesis","The development of artificial gravity and force fields has led to the fact that we have learned how to manipulate objects with high precision at some distance. Powerful industrial units allow us to move cargo without mechanical manipulators, separate rocks in asteroids, make wells, deform objects and increase pressure by reducing volume with gravity and force fields.
Lightweight handhelds, on the other hand, have fewer capabilities, but somehow make life easier in cramped station space, where hoisting mechanisms cannot be used. We still don't know how to change mass in practice, so these installations are very energy-consuming. Industrial telekinesis makes it possible to change the means of controlling mechanisms and the ways of extracting minerals.",""
"research_done_description_productionOfAntimatter","Antimatter is a substance of antiparticles that cannot be stably formed under normal conditions. It is unknown why the baryonic asymmetry arose, to which we owe the almost complete absence of antimatter, possibly due to the substitution of antimatter by dark matter.
We have begun to record antimatter decay products coming from the Kuiper Belt, and have subsequently become convinced that it is there and that extraction is profitable.
It took a lot of effort to develop vehicles that could operate safely in the Kuiper Belt. Being there itself is a dangerous undertaking, so passive protection for ships had to be developed. Detecting and extracting antimatter is extremely painstaking work, it's incredibly low, 1g per 100 tons of mass. It's crucial to capture pure antimatter so as not to lose the antimatter we've already accumulated.
With force fields, we were able to create limited conditions like a Penning's trap, within which the antimatter can be safely stored. The installation fields cannot be stopped to avoid annihilation.",""
"research_done_description_cryogenics","Interstellar travel is currently impossible without cryogenics. The resources available for accommodation on the ship are limited, and the journey is so long that in its time the crew can grow trivially old with modern technology. The difference between orbit and Earth's surface is about 40 microseconds a day. At great distances from massive Stars, even a speed close to the speed of light does not compensate for the acceleration of time. Suspension of processes in the body is vital.
Cryogenics provides access to slowing down human biological processes. The body is slowly cooled with paramagnetic salts, and cells are filled with glucose in the process to protect against ice crystals. Sleep without dreams sets in. The temperature along the way is maintained automatically. A few days are spent reversing the process so as not to damage the cells and allow the body to die from diabetes. It is very unpleasant, but there is no other way yet. Those who have gone through this process do not lose their abilities, skills or memory.",""
"research_done_description_photonicPowerPlant","When we oxidize a hydrogen molecule, we get a conditional unit of energy; when we fission a nucleus of uranium-235 ~5.8 million; when we fuse helium into fusion, about 4 times more; when we annihilate, 264 times more energy. We already use annihilation for propulsion. An antimatter reactor can be built on the same principle. The photon momentum energy is converted into working body energy and then into electricity. The residual neutrons are collected in a storage unit and go to the necessary targets. One problem remains - neutrinos. In theory, sooner or later we can simply absorb all the matter of the universe.
It is strange that life inside the universe is forced at a certain stage of development to consume something it cannot exist without. We hope it doesn't go too far. As of today, the Theory of Everything is complete, and so far we do not know how to find a more efficient way of extracting energy that does not damage the universe.",""
"research_done_description_photonicEngine","The photon engine, once only a hypothesis of science fiction, is now a reality. Indeed, the principle based on annihilation turned out to be the most useful. The installation looks not at all like a concave mirror, but rather like a hadron collider with an incredibly powerful magnetic installation of two half-rings.
The operation requires the collision of matter and antimatter from the two gas pedals with high precision. Upon collision, the antipodes disappear, leaving behind photons with a charged momentum, the energy of which we use for propulsion. In the collision, the matter also decays into gamma rays and neutrinos in equal fractions. Neutrinos do not interact with anything, which means that we lose them irretrievably. The problem arises: we convert matter to nothing, which does not interact with anything.",""
"research_done_description_interstellarShip","The discovery of cryogenics for human long-term flight transfer, artificial gravity, propulsion, and an antimatter reactor makes interstellar travel real for humans. The probes sent earlier are transmitting curious data that suggests that there are plenty of star systems with exoplanets around us.
The photon propulsion system is capable of accelerating the ship to near-light speeds, but this can only be done when it goes beyond the Oort cloud. One way or another, particles remain in interstellar space, which could hit the ship's skin, gradually erasing the coating and destroying it. On a voyage like this, you can't leave the ship unprotected. In flight we will apply plasma force fields, which will repel objects from the cladding and partially absorb free hydrogen molecules suitable for plasma, which is very useful, because at near-light speeds it gets heavier, leaves a small trace and becomes weaker.",""

Your mission is not just to explore and colonize the nearest planets, but to pave the way for humanity further, to the most remote corners of the solar system, and perhaps beyond... Ahead of you are incredible challenges and discoveries that can change the future of our civilization",""
"solargene_mission_text1","An orbital radio telescope, performing a routine scan of the sky, detected an anomalous signal emanating from the constellation Centaurus. This signal attracted the attention of scientists, since its characteristics do not correspond to known space objects. A team of specialists began a detailed analysis of the data to determine the nature of the signal. It is assumed that this may be a rare astronomical phenomenon or a signal from an unknown source. In the coming days, additional observations and studies will be carried out to confirm or refute the hypotheses. If new interesting data emerges, the scientific community will be promptly informed for further study and discussion",""
"solargene_mission_text2","We have received another signal from space, and this time we have been able to pinpoint its source. The signal comes from the star 'Proxima Centauri', one of the closest stars to Earth in our galaxy. This discovery has generated great interest in the scientific community, since 'Proxima Centauri' is a red dwarf and has not been previously observed to be so active. Our astronomers have already begun a thorough study of this star using modern telescopes and instruments. They hope to find out what is causing this signal and how it may be related to other astronomical phenomena. This discovery may open up new avenues for understanding the Universe and its mysteries.",""
"solargene_mission_text3","Recently, our astronomers have begun receiving a stable signal from Proxima Centauri. This may be a sign of a natural origin for the signal, which opens up exciting opportunities for scientific research. We plan to conduct a detailed analysis of the data to try to decipher this mysterious signal. If we can figure out its nature, it could be a major step in understanding the Universe and its evolution. If successful, our discoveries could revolutionize science and technology, providing new tools for studying space",""
"solargene_mission_text4","There is no longer any doubt that the signal is artificial in origin, and this discovery could be the most important in human history. We continue to closely monitor the Proxima Centauri system so as not to miss a single detail. If our assumptions are confirmed, it could change our understanding of the Universe and our place in it. Just in case, we have developed a simple signal language and are sending our message to Proxima Centauri, hoping that we will be heard and understood",""
"solargene_mission_text5","Our scientists are inclined to think that the signal is coming from the planet closest to the star, Proxima Centauri b, which is in the habitable zone. Most likely, the planet is in tidal lock, in which case life on it is possible on the terminator (the border between light and darkness). It seems incredible that life could have originated on such an unpredictable star as a red dwarf!",""
"solargene_mission_text6","We managed to partially decode the signal! There is no doubt that these are signals from extraterrestrial intelligence! Apparently, these are quite powerful broadcast signals of a civilization that has recently entered the industrial era. We don't know if they will be able to receive our signals, much less if they will be able to decode them. We have increased the power of the messages we transmit by orders of magnitude. But even if they can decipher the signal, the conversation will be very difficult and long - messages reach one side in 4 years and 3 months.",""
"solargene_mission_text7","Alarming data - our new possible friends may be in danger due to the growing activity of their star. They are unlikely to know about this - their science is clearly not yet developed enough. We also cannot yet accurately predict the behavior of red dwarfs, fortunately, our capabilities now allow us to build such models, but this will take the time necessary to observe many red dwarfs in the part of the universe visible to us",""
"solargene_mission_text8","We built a model of the behavior of Proxima Centauri, and according to it it turns out that the previous millions of years the star was very calm, which allowed life (intelligent life!) to arise there. But now the star is quickly entering a period of instability, which is very likely to make the terminator of the planet Proxima Centauri b uninhabitable in a few years. We are transmitting a warning signal, but even if the Centaurians receive it and can even decipher it, they are unlikely to have time to prepare and survive the cataclysm. The good news is that at our current pace of research, we will be able to build an interstellar ship and send a rescue team. They need to arrive at least in {fly_years} years, in advance, before the active phase of the cataclysm, to establish contact and help overcome the catastrophe with the help of our technology.
